        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code when I was in middle school because I loved working on and building computers.
          I viewed code as the ability to build logical structures with the mind and found the process very exciting,
          even at a young age. Overtime, I learned how to use my code to make video games, help manage my files,
          and on to help making tools for my workplace to make my team more efficient.</p>

        <h3>Team Management</h3>
        <p>Over the years and in every job I've worked, I've had several opportunities to take on the role of team lead
          in my workplaces. My honesty and integrity has made me a reliable choice for those in charge of me, and my sincerity
          and commitment has allowed me to be reliable leader for those I've been put in charge of. My experiences as both a follower
          and a leader have taught me much and helped me grow into a strong and capable team leader.</p>
